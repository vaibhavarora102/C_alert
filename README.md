### What is our problem? How are we solving this?

Out of the major world problems we are facing today burglary/ robbery is one of them. Due to this serious problem, we have a fear of insecurity in some way. While robbery a lot of precious lives came to an end and a lot of capital got wasted in unfair means.

To solve this problem our team tried to develop an application, not 100% but we can say our application may help to reduce burglary to some extent. Our application will analyze the video and alert us if any weird is going to happen. From weird I mean to say if someone is trying to open a door or window with some unexpected means like tools or someone is trying to come into the house by climbing the balcony or viewing inside the house 

### Features

Everyone needs security whether it is in a Bank, Mall, Shop, or House.

- In Malls, Shops generally the cases of robbery take place. They require additional security along with CCTV so that CCTV footage can also detect whether something weird is going to happen, and alerts the Shopkeeper. Rather than seeing CCTV footage after the robbery occurs, our application will detect it in real time. Hence, the chances of robbery may reduce to some extent.
- This could also be very beneficial for Banks when it comes to security. Even in the presence of Great security (CCTV, Police Guards), the cases of robbery occurs because sometimes we fail to notice these things before it happens, but CCTV records some weird moments also.
- The same thing we can use in our homes, streets, etc because everyone needs security to an extent is possible.

So along with CCTV footage, if we embed this detection feature to it will be more beneficial and helps in the reduction of burglary to some extent.

### Future Scope is

- To analyze the live stream rather than recorded video.
- To send location, image, phone number, and other useful information to nearest police station automatically once something weird is detected.
- To build up proper authentication for the application.
