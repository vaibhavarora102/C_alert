## About
The project is focused to control the increasing theft and buglar cases. As we know govt is now days installing cameras at every streets and more over many home owners and shop owner prefer to install cctv survillence. we had applied our Object loacalization model over live video stream that whether the everything is normal or something suspecious is happening like person threatneing by showing gun, knife or anything and more  

## Problem statement and solution proposed

Out of the major world problems we are facing today burglary/ robbery is one of them. Due to this serious problem, we have a fear of insecurity in some way. While robbery a lot of precious lives came to an end and a lot of capital got wasted in unfair means. It's an important issue that nowdays bulgar are using nowdays, just by simply threatning the either tries to kidnap or do their needs fulfilled. 

To solve this problem our team tried to develop an application, Our application will analyze the video and by using pre trained model will detect that whether something weird (person threatning by knife, rod, gun or doing other suspecious things). we had proposed both web based app and mobile based app so that it is aligned with the future scope and could help the larger community of users.  

## Features

Everyone needs security whether it is in a Bank, Mall, Shop, or House.

- In Malls, Shops generally the cases of robbery take place. They require additional security along with CCTV so that CCTV footage can also detect whether something weird is going to happen, and alerts the Shopkeeper. Rather than seeing CCTV footage after the robbery occurs, our application will detect it in real time. Hence, the chances of robbery may reduce to some extent.
- This could also be very beneficial for Banks when it comes to security. Even in the presence of Great security (CCTV, Police Guards), the cases of robbery occurs because sometimes we fail to notice these things before it happens, but CCTV records some weird moments also.
- The same thing we can use in our homes, streets, etc because everyone needs security to an extent is possible.

So along with CCTV footage, if we embed this detection feature to it will be more beneficial and helps in the reduction of burglary to some extent.

## Future Scope is

- To send location, image, phone number, and other useful information to nearest police station automatically once something weird is detected and also start alarms or buzzer.
- To build up a system which could be confined to specific user only in concern to security purpose.
- Face recognition of person identified to be culprit for whole condition and sending same information to officials.

***
## Use Webapp
- Firstly install requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Then run the following command `python manage.py runserver` to start the Django server
- Enjoy!
